Hello Shuai, the following steps are just my suggestion, you can skip to do anything as you want

Step 1: read Rob's paper and Isaac's thesis in the "Paper" folder

Step 2: run and play some Matlab simulation from "Matlab/FPTD_BER.rar" to see different results of different designs (benchmark, RCP, BTWC and RCP_BTWC)

Step 3: run verilog simulation from "Verilog/FPTD_verilog.rar" for the ASIC design to understand how the ASIC work. Pay attendtion to the input and output data flow and the data structure of four test blocks
